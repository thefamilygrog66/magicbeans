Magic Beans (magicbeans) mod for Minetest

by thefamilygrog66

Description: This mod randomly spawns four different types of magic beans: running, jumping and flying - which when eaten, give the player that magical ability for 30 seconds - and beanstalk beans, which when planted (dropped) will grow a magic beanstalk up to the clouds! It's highly recommended that this mod is only used with 'enable damage' unchecked!

Note:
The default bean textures are 64px - if you prefer 16px, they're included as well. Simply change the texture file names (e.g. magicbeans_jumping.png --> magicbeans_jumping64.png, magicbeans_jumping16.png --> magicbeans_jumping.png, etc.) accordingly.

Mod dependencies: default
