Magic Beans (magicbeans) mod for Minetest

by thefamilygrog66

Description: This mod randomly spawns three different types of magic beans - running, jumping and flying - which when eaten, give the player that magical ability for 30 seconds. Because of the inherent danger of temporarily flying, jumping really high or running really fast, it's highly recommended that this mod is only used with 'enable damage' unchecked!

Note: The default textures are 64px - if you prefer 16px, they're included as well. Simply change the texture file names (e.g. magicbeans_jumping.png --> magicbeans_jumping64.png, magicbeans_jumping16.png --> magicbeans_jumping.png, etc.) accordingly.

Mod dependencies: default
